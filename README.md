# Daikibo Data Analysis & Forensic Technology Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of a data analytics and forensic technology simulation.
It focuses on operational efficiency analysis and ethical investigation using real-world styled datasets.

## Task 1: Data Analysis (Tableau)
**Objective:** Identify machine downtime patterns across Daikibo factories.

**Work Performed:**
- Imported unified JSON telemetry data from four factories
- Created a calculated downtime metric based on unhealthy machine states
- Built bar charts showing:
  - Down time per factory
  - Down time per device type
- Created an interactive Tableau dashboard with factory-level filtering

**Outcome:**
- Identified the factory with the highest downtime
- Identified machine types contributing most to failures

## Task 2: Forensic Technology (Excel)
**Objective:** Assist in investigating potential gender pay inequality.

**Work Performed:**
- Analyzed equality scores ranging from -100 to +100
- Added an Equality Class column using conditional logic
- Classified data into:
  - Fair
  - Unfair
  - Highly Discriminative

**Outcome:**
- Enabled clearer forensic conclusions regarding pay equality across job roles and locations
